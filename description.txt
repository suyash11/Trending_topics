Task2: Discover top 10 trending topics in the news articles given in **Data-1**.
    
    What I Understood From the Problem ?
    -> In this task, we have to retrieve the headings of the data from the file and on the basis
       of word count we have to identify which topics are in trend. For this, we are given a file 
       from which we have collected all the headings and stored it in a single string. We have 
       tokenized the string and removed all the stop words from the string. Then we have stemmed 
       the words using NLTK. We have calculated the frequency of every word in the string, sorted 
       the string and returned the top 10 words.

    Algorithm Used:
    
    Step 1. Parse CSV file and convert it into list.
    Step 2. Select heading column from each row of the list and store it in a string.
    Step 3. Tokenize the string using stop word set.
    Step 4. Stem the words in the string using NLTK.
    Step 5. Calculate the frequency of every word in the string and sort them.
    Step 6. Return the top 10 words.
